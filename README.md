## Hi there 👋

- 🏠 I moved to San Francisco in 2024 with my wife Hannah ([@hdreyer](https://github.com/hdreyer))
- 🦾 I spend most of my time building and managing agents
- 🔭 I’m currently taking a six-month sabbatical while I figure out what I want to work on next
- 💼 Most recently, I've spent the past five years as an Engineering Director after 15+ years as a developer
- ✍️ I occasionally write about software engineering on [Medium](https://medium.com/@richardmorgantx), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rickmorgan/), [X](https://x.com/morgan4tx), and [richardmorgan.com](https://richardmorgan.com/)
- 🌱 Lately, I've been enjoying learning how to create immutable infrastructure with Packer & Ansible

Fun facts:
- ✈️ I spent several years as a digital nomad and have visited nearly 50 countries
- 🎶 I played classical 🎹 and rock 🥁 when I was younger and am currently learning 🎸
