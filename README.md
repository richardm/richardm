## Hi there 👋

- 🏠 I moved to San Francisco in 2024 with my wife Hannah ([@hdreyer](https://github.com/hdreyer))
- 🔭 I’m currently taking a six-month sabbatical while I figure out what I want to work on next
- 🦾 These days, I spend most of my time learning GTM strategies and building agents
- 💼 I've been a full-stack engineer for 20 years and Engineering Director for 5 years
- ✍️ I occasionally write about software engineering on [Medium](https://medium.com/@richardmorgantx), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rickmorgan/), [X](https://x.com/morgan4tx), and [richardmorgan.com](https://richardmorgan.com/)

Fun facts:
- ✈️ I spent several years as a digital nomad and have visited nearly 50 countries
- 🎶 I played classical 🎹 and rock 🥁 when I was younger and am currently learning 🎸
- 👔 In 2012, I ran for Congress against Lamar Smith to protest his Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) [earning a shoutout from the Austin-American Statesman](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uco2p/its_richard_morgan_who_challenged_lamar_smith_in/)
- 📈 I later ran for Dallas Colleges Board of Trustees and [came in 2nd with 30% of the vote](https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/TX/Dallas/61322/168577/Web01/en/summary.html)
